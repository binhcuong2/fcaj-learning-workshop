## Clean Up Resources

After completing the workshop, it is essential to **delete all AWS resources** to avoid ongoing charges. Even though many services fall under the AWS Free Tier, some resources (like DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, and CloudWatch alarms) will continue to incur costs if left running.

This section provides a comprehensive guide to remove all resources created during the workshop.
